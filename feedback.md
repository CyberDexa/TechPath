Feedback:
1. I think the AI tutor should only appear when you’re in the module
2. ⁠It should really be “context-aware”. It is context aware in that it knows that I am in the Frontend track, but when I asked it for a summary of this module that I am  see its response. An idea for approaching this will be to have a summary.txt file that has a summary of each module, and this is fed into the context of the AI so that it can respond effectively using that context
3. ⁠We don’t need to show the model being used “GPT-4o-mini”
